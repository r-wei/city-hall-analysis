During its August 22,2013, Board of Directors Meeting, the East Point
Condominium Association ("East Point"), consisting of a 160-unit, 43-story, pre-1975
building, in the Edgewater Neighborhood ofthe City of Chicago, voted to approve the
filing of this letter of Proposed Amendments before the Mayor and the City Council of
the City of Chicago requesting that the Mayor or the City Council cause the abovereferenced benchmarking ordinance, presentiy scheduled to come before the City
Council during its September 11,2013 meeting, to be remanded to the Committee on
Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards (the "Qimmittee") for further review and
amendment consistent with the Proposed Amendments set forth below prior to any
final vote on the matter by the City Council.
East Points Position
As is the case with the Building Owners and Managers Association International
organization ^ East Point supports voluntary energy use benchmarking and encourages
its Association members to participate in its annual benchmarking activities using

automated data-collection programs, where available, such as the EPA's ENERGY STAR
Portfolio Manager platform or other similar programs (the "Tool").
Also, while East Point acknowledges that energy efficiency is a key component of
the Sustainable Chicago 2015 Action Agenda'*, it supports Alderman Brendan Reill/s call
for amendments to the Ordinance necessary to "better shield condominium and co-op
owners from the financial burden" associated with the Ordinance.^
Additionally, East Point desires that Chicago's energy benchmarking efforts,
which will be among a few leading cities^ in the country with such programs intended to
incentivize building owners to reduce their energy profiles and costs, should be
performed in a manner that supports and does not include excessive unfunded
mandates and costs, does not impede the market for private real estate transactions^
and adequately protects the privacy of individual homeowners while fostering a
consistent level of competitiveness among like properties.^
Therefore, East Point seeks to have the Ordinance remanded to the Committee
and amended in accordance with the following Proposed Amendments.
Proposed Amendments
A.
General.
Unless the Commissioner of Business Affairs and
Consumer Protection has the staff and budgetary support to commence the
development ofthe rules, regulations, procedures, forms, educational tools and support
systems promptly after passage ofthe Ordinance that are necessary and appropriate for
the proper implementation of the Ordinance, the Committee should amend all
deadlines set forth in the Ordinance by extending them by one calendar year each.

B. Definitions (18-14-101.3).
(1)
There is no definition for what constitutes a Tenant." Define 'Tenant"
to mean a person or entity occupying, holding possession of or in control of a building or
premises pursuant to a rental agreement.
(2)
The definition of "Building" is very broad. To preclude its application to
residential or industrial usage, its definition should be limited in scope. Define
"Building" to mean a structure, or part thereof, enclosing any non-residential or nonindustrial use or occupancy.
C

Solicitation of Compliance Information (18-14-101.4).

(1)
First Paragraph is overly broad as to "all information that cannot
otherwise be acquired by the building owner." Amend to read: "...all information that
cannot otherwise be acquired by the building owner with the exercise of reasonable
diligence at nominal costs..."
(2)
Third Paragraph's language may create unintended, harsh results for
building owners where Tenants fait to or are unable to provide the required
information in a timely fashion. Amend the language to read: 'The failure of any
Tenant to provide the information required under this section to the owner of a
covered building shall not relieve such owner ofthe obligation to benchmark the
building as provided in Section 18-14-102.1, provided that such owner shall not be
required to benchmark such information not reported by a Tenant unless otherwise
available to such owner with the exercise of reasonable diligence at nominal costs."
D. Enforcement (18-14-101.5).
(1)
Subsection (a) is too weak and indefinite. Amend the Second Sentence to
read: 'The commissioner shall adopt rules and regulations for the proper
administration and enforcement of this chapter not later than 120 days after the date
this ordinance takes effect."
(2)
In order to ensure small building owners are not unduly impacted in a
punitive manner by the fines structure, include an annual limit and initial period to
remedy the violation before subsequent fines commence. Amend Subsection (b) to
read: "Any person who violates this chapter shall be subject to a fine of up to $100.00
for the first violation during the entire first 30-dav period after the failure in compliance.
and an additional fine of up to $25.00 for each day that the violation continues after
such initial 30-dav period: provided, however, that no person mav be fined more than
$1.500.00 during any calendar year.

E.
Data Verification (18-14-102.2).
it is not clear why a licensed
professional (i.e., professional engineer or registered architect) is needed to verify the
data entered during the benchmarking process.^ The building owners have sufficient
competitive and legal incentive to ensure that they are entering the proper type and
amount of information during the benchmarking process and should not have to incur
further costs associated with having third parties look pver their shoulders. However,
the proposed language does make sense in the following scenario. Amend the First
Paragraph to read: "In the event the owner of a covered building is eligible for and
desires to register for ENERGY STAR certification, then prior to the first benchmarking
deadline prescribed by Section 18-14-102.1, and prior to each fifth deadline thereafter,
the owner of a covered building shall ensure that reported benchmarking information
for that year is verified by a licenses professional."
F.
Benchmarking (18-14-102.3).
The Committee should give
consideration to amending this provision so that utility companies are required to
develop and maintain the capability for a "direct upload" of benchmark data from the
Tool so that owners and tenants can be released from the manual benchmarking
obligation.
G.
Disclosure (18-14-102.3).
While it is a clear incentive for the
competitive market place among t)uildings of like size and usage to prescribe that the
commissioner shall report "summary" statistics to the public on benchmarking
information, energy efficiency trends, cost savings and job creation effects resulting
from energy efficiency improvements, and except for private-party sales transaction,
there is no legitimate public need to know "individually-identifiable" benchmarking
information about owners and tenants. ^°
It is recommended that the Committee amend this section as follows: (1)
change Subsection (c) to read: "The commissioner is authorized to make only summary
benchmarking information i-eadiiy available to the public." (2) Amend the First
Exception to read: "Except to the extent required by applicable law, the commissioner
shall not make available to the public, any individuaily-attributable reported
benchmarking information [words removed] that a covered building is required to

benchmark; provided, however, that such information may be required to be provided
among the parties to a private sales transaction involving a covered building."

Relief Requested
We respectfully request that, prior to final passage by the Chicago City Council,
the June 26, 2013 proposed Building Energy Use Benchmarking Ordinance (Chapter 1814) be remanded back to the Committee on Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards
for revisions consistent with the above-stated Proposed Amendments.
