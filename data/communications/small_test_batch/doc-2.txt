PFC revenue. Such leases or use agreements will not preclude the public agency from
funding, developing, or assigning new capacity at the airport with PFC revenue.
6. Carryover provisions. It will not enter into any lease or use agreement with any air
carrier or foreign air carrier for any facility financed in whole or in part with revenue
derived from a passenger facility charge if such agreement for such facility contains a
carryover provision regarding a renewal option which, upon expiration ofthe original
lease, would operate to automatically extend the term of such agreement with such
carrier in preference to any potentially competing air carrier or foreign air carrier seeking
to negotiate a lease or use agreement for such facilities.
7. Competitive access. It agrees that any lease or use agreements between the public
agency and any air carrier or foreign air carrier for any facility financed in whole or in
part with revenue derived from a passenger facility charge will contain a provision that
permits the public agency to terminate the lease or use agreement if—

foreign air carrier.
(c) Notwithstanding the limitation provided in subparagraph (b), with respect to a project
for terminal development, gates and related areas, or a facility occupied or used by one
or more air carriers or foreign air carriers on an exclusive or preferential basis, the rates,
fees, and charges payable by such carriers that use such facilities will be no less than
the rates, fees, and charges paid by such carriers using similar facilities at the airport
that were not financed by PFC revenue.

Re: Gary/Chicago International Airport
Capital Improvement Program (2015-2020)
Dear Mr. Rector:
I want to begin by telling you that we are experiencing some exciting times at our facility. In addition to being
in the homestretch on the runway extension program, we are encouraged by the conviction of others as we
seek opportunities to realize our full potential. Recently, we have entered into agreements with a second
Fixed Base Operator who is investing in excess of $3M to construct a new FBO facility and Hangar complex.
We have also transitioned the management of the Airport to the public-private partnership that will provide
valuable expertise and attract at least $100M of private investment over the next 40 years.
As we work to provide these new ventures and our current users with a quality airfield, it is imperative that we
not only expand our infrastructure, but also maintain and improve our existing facilities. Therefore; on behalf
of the Gary/Chicago International Airport Authority (GCIAA), we are pleased to submit our proposed Capital
Improvement Program for fiscal years 2015 - 2020. As you may know, GCIAA has made substantial progress
on the runway expansion program. The railroad has been relocated and the benri has been removed. Please
know that we are currently on track to open the runway extension to full length in June and to commission the
new approaches in August of this year.
Now that the runway project is in its final stages, we need to focus on the other needs of the airfield. The past
Pavement Condition Index study commissioned by your office reaffirms what we had always suspected. A
substantial amount of our pavements are in dire need of rehabilitation. GCIAA has utilized approximately
$1.8M of our TIF dollars to complete the rehabilitation of the apron in front of the new Gary Jet Center hangar
and to complete the design for the rehabilitation of the terminal and GA ramps. Unfortunately, our remaining
and future TIF dollars are pledged to complete the runway expansion program. We are finalizing a PFC
application with the City of Chicago to complete the apron rehabilitation tasks. As for the runways and
taxiways, we strongly urge INDOT and the FAA to support the long overdue pavement rehabilitation projects
listed in the CIP.
We tmst that you__will find these projects acceptable as we all work toward our goal of improving the

 Capital Improvement Program Justification
GARY/CHICAGO
INTERNATIONAL
FY 2016 - 2020 (mcluding

AIRPORT
2015)

The Runway Expansion Program is nearing completion. There will still be several disbursements
for the program listed within this CIP and will be reimbursed as funding becomes available. Please
note that no other discretionary or non-primary funds other than what is listed below can be utilized
for the runway extension program due to the LOI agreement.
While the current CIP submittal is looking into future years 2016 through 2020, we are including
additional 2015 discretionary requests based on the needs identified in the previously completed
PCI study. The following sections describe the purpose and need for various projects within our
Capital Improvement Plan.
1.

LOI Program Reimbursement

(LOI & FAA NPE Funds)

FY 2015

The Runway Expansion Program is anticipated to be complete this year and the reimbursement will
be ongoing. This disbursement will provide the next allocation of funds. The FAA funds utilized for
this disbursement include $2.84M of LOI discretionary and $1M of NPE funds. The total program
cost associated with this request is $4,266,667.

Rehabilitate Runway "02-20" & Taxiway "B" South
(FAA Discretionary)

FY 2015

You only need to look at the 2011 photo
on Google Earth to realize that the
majority of the pavements at the Airport
are in dire need of reconstruction. This
is further supported by the recent PCI
study commissioned by INDOT. The
priorities are Runway "2-20", Taxiways
"B" & "C" and Taxiway "A" in that order.
Because of the magnitude of this
project, it will be important to phase this
effort to accomplish as large a scope as
can reasonable be completed in one
construction season. This task provides
for the design and reconstruction of the
south half of Runway "02-20". As a
result of its intersection with Runway
"12-30", extra attention will have to be
given to the phasing of this program
which can contribute to the cost.
The airfield pavements associated with Taxiways "B" & "C" and the associated connectors are also
in desperate need of reconstruction. As this project anticipates a reconstruction effort, this project
includes the relocation of the southern portion of Taxiway "B" that does not meet the current
taxiway offset standards. This will result in better orientation of the taxiway hold position lines and
correction of the non-standard signage. This project also anticipates the use of FAA discretionary
funds to complete the program in the amount of $4.9M.

 Rehabilitate Apron - Phase I {PFC

FY 2015

Funding)

Per the recent PCI report, the most dire pavements on the
airport are predominantly in the area of the terminal apron
and the general aviation aprons to the east. All of these
areas are well below the minimum service levels and are
bordering upon the level of "Poor" and "Failure". As seen in
the attached photo, the pavement is very poor and alligator
cracking is predominant. Although GYY has a proactive
crack sealing program, this pavement is getting to the point
that it is difficult to seal these areas. We have opted to use a
portion of our ADZ TIF funds to complete the design;
however, the balance of our TIF funds have been committed
to the Runway program in order to leverage an additional
$30M of Regional Development Authority funding. Therefore,
this project remains a top priority for 2015 and seeks
discretionary funding. This project has been divided into
phases for the purposes of construction as well funding.
Phase I of the apron rehab program requires $2,000,000.
The additional four phases of the apron rehab program
requires funding in the amounts of $2,000,000, $2,500,000,
$2,500,000 and $1,125,000 respectively. Ideally, Phase I, II,
III, IV, & V should be constructed concurrently; however, they
have been separated to provide flexibility for any amount of
available funds.

Update Airport Master Plan - Phase I (PFC Funds)

FY 2015

The current Master Plan was completed and approved in 2001. It will soon be 15 years old and the
majority of the airfield improvement projects will have been completed. The completion of the
Runway "12-30" Extension and Safety Area Correction project will likely result in an increase of
aircraft traffic resulting from either new airline users or other larger aircraft users. For this reason,
we must begin thinking about the long term future of the Airport. Toward this end, we anticipate
using PFC funds over two years to begin the next update of the Airport's Master Plan and Airport
Layout Plan.

5.

Snow Removal Equipment - Truck & Plow (FAA

Discretionary)

FY 2015

GYY has in excess of 4,000,000 square feet of airfield pavement that is cleared during every snow
event. And while the airport has a large fleet of equipment, much of the equipment is old and
expensive to repair and maintain. The last new pieces of snow equipment were purchased in 2006
and are nearing their anticipated life of 10 years as well. The other equipment is approaching 20 to
30 years in age. While pavement rehabilitation is vital, it is our goal to get on a revolving schedule
of replacing one unit of equipment every three years and increase that rotation to every two years
once the pavement rehabilitation effort is complete. The airport is seeking discretionary funds to
support a total project amount of $450,000.

LOI Program Reimbursement

(FAA NPE Funds)

FY 2016

This disbursement will provide the next allocation of funds. The FAA funds utilized for this
disbursement include $1M of NPE funds. The total program cost associated with this request is
$1,111,111.

Gary/Chicago International Airport

 7.

Rehabilitate Taxiway "A" (FAA Discretionary)

FY 2016

Taxiway "A" is another component of the airfield pavement that needs rehabilitation. Taxiway A
was preserved with a slurry seal coat in 2005; however, it has reached its useful life and is now in
need of more permanent reconstruction. This project will include a phased reconstructive effort that
will maintain operations and traffic to and from Runway "12-30" and the aprons. This project seeks
FAA discretionary funds in order to complete this rehabilitation task. The total program cost for this
task is estimated to be $7.8M.
8.

Rehabilitate Apron - Phases II ( P F C Funding)

FY 2016

This project provides for the second phase of the apron rehabilitation discussed under Item 3
above. The airport is seeking PFC funds to support this phase of the project in the amount of
$2,000,000.

9.

Update Airport Master Plan - Phase II ( P F C Funds)

FY 2016

This project provides for the second phase of the airport master plan update discussed above
under item 3. The airport is seeking PFC funds to support this phase of the project in the amount of
$500,000.

10.

Snow Removal Equipment ( S R E ) Building Expansion (FAA Discretionary)

FY 2016

This project provides for the expansion of the Snow Removal Equipment Building. With the
additional equipment necessary for the airports snow removal operation, it is necessary to expand
the building. We currently have more equipment than we can fit into our existing facility. The
airport is seeking discretionary funds to support a total program cost of $1,050,000.

11.

LOI Program Reimbursement (FAA N P E Funds)

FY 2017

This disbursement will provide the next allocation of funds. The FAA funds utilized for this
disbursement include $1M of NPE funds. The total program cost associated with this request is
$1,111,111.

12.

Rehabilitate Runway "12-30" - Phase I (FAA Discretionary)

FY 2017

Runway 12-30 was milled and overlaid in 2004. This rehabilitation method was considered to be a
ten year fix and it was known that at some point, a more extensive reconstruction effort would be
required. The current PC! indicates that the runway is nearly below the minimum service levels
now; however, the pavement will be monitored and repairs will be made as needed to ensure that it
lasts until this effort can be completed. This phase will complete the rehabilitation from the west
extension to Runway "02-20". The total project costs for this request are $4,625,000.

13.

Rehabilitate Apron - Phases III ( P F C Funding)

FY 2017

This project provides for the third phase of the apron rehabilitation discussed above under Item 3.
The airport is seeking PFC funds to support this phase of the project in the amount of $2,500,000.

 14.

LOI Program Reimbursement (FAA N P E Funds)

FY 2018

This disbursement will provide the final allocation of approved funds. The FAA funds utilized for
this disbursement include $550,000 of NPE funds. The total program cost associated with this
request is $611,111.

15.

Rehabilitate Runway "12-30" - Phase II (FAA Discretionary)

FY 2018

This project will be the second phase of the runway rehabilitation program and will include the
section of the runway from Runway "2-20" to a point just past Taxiway "A-2". The total program
cost associated with this request is $5,625,000.

16.

Terminal Expansion - Design (FAA Discretionary)

F Y 2018

With the increased runway length, it is anticipated that GYY will have increased passenger traffic
which will increase the demand on the terminal building. The current terminal size only allows for
one aircraft at a time, simply due to the size of the passenger hold room. Thus, conceptual floor
plans for a two story expansion to the east were developed. The concept provided for a Customs &
Border Patrol area on the lower floor with a complete holding area on the second floor, as well as
an additional passenger loading bridge. The expansion of this terminal was included in the EIS and
ROD. This project provides for the completion of the design and preparation of bid documents.
The total cost associated with this request is $600,000.

17.

New A R F F Facility - Design & C A T E X (FAA Discretionary)

F Y 2018

The increase in the passenger hold room capacity will likely be followed up with an expansion of the
baggage handling area. As the current baggage handling is accomplished in the western portion of
the existing terminal, it is logical that a building expansion to the west will be required in the near
future as well. Currently, the existing ARFF facility is located to the west and in the way of any
future expansion. The existing ARFF facility is also outdated and the current ARFF vehicles barely
fit within the facility. A new ARFF facility site has been identified on the south side of the airport
near the control tower. It is expected that a minimal level of environmental work will be required in
order to obtain a CatEx. This phase of the project will provide for the design and bidding portion of
the project. The total cost associated with this request is $200,000.

18. Rehabilitate Apron - Phases IV (PFC Funding)

FY 2018

This project provides for the fourth phase of the apron rehabilitation as discussed above under item
3. The airport is seeking PFC funds to support this phase of the project in the amount of
$2,500,000.

19.

Snow Removal Equipment - Snow Broom (FAA Discretionary)

FY 2018

GYY has in excess of 4,000,000 square feet of airfield pavement that is cleared during every snow
event. And while the airport has a large fleet of equipment, much of the equipment is old and
expensive to repair and maintain. The last new pieces of snow equipment were purchased in 2006
and are nearing their anticipated life of 10 years as well. The other equipment is approaching 20 to
30 years in age. While pavement rehabilitation is vital, it is our goal to get on a revolving schedule

 of replacing one unit of equipment every three years and increase that rotation to every two years
once the pavement rehabilitation effort is complete. The airport is seeking discretionary funds to
support a total project amount of $500,000.

20.

Rehabilitate Runway "12-30" - Phase III (FAA

Discretionary)

FY 2019

This project will be the third and final phase of the runway rehabilitation program and will include
the section of the runway from just past Taxiway "A-2" to the end of Runway "30". The total
program cost associated with this request is $5,625,000.

21.

New ARFF Facility - Construction

(FAA

FY 2020

This project tackles the remaining phase of Runway "2-20" and Taxiway "B" rehabilitation effort.
This phase will complete all work north of Runway "12-30". The Airport is seeking FAA
discretionary funds for this project. The total project cost associated with this request is $4.4M.

25.

Install Runway Incursion Caution Lights (FAA

Discretionary)

FY 2020

In an effort to prevent runway incursions, GYY desires to install
Runway Guard Lights (RGLs). RGLs have proven to be an
additional tool to caution pilots and airfield personnel about the
approaching runway area. We recently obtained several light
units from Chicago O'Hare. This task will provide a much safer
environment on the airfield. We anticipate using local funds to
install the bases, conduits, cables and vault equipment for a total
project cost of $375,000.

 26.

Install Parking Revenue Equipment (Local Funds)

FY 2020

The current state of the property tax system has had an effect on many airports abilities to meet
operating budget needs. In addition to the budget woes, GYY has incurred many expenses
associated with ongoing operation and management of the airport. In the past, we have utilized a
contractor to implement and collect parking revenues manually. This project will include the
installation of automated equipment that was purchased in the past. In order to accomplish this, we
are utilizing local funds to install the automated parking revenue equipment. No funds are being
requested for this project. This is a demand-driven project and may be accelerated should airline
service commence.

Briefly describe below your "Airport Pavement Maintenance/Management Proqram":
Airport pavement surfaces are inspected during daily and monthly inspections (monthly Inspections replace annual
inspections). Daily inspections check for pavement surface irregularities that may present hazards to aircraft. Identified
hazards are recorded and then repair action is immediately initiated to ensure aircraft safety. Monthly inspections record
ongoing pavement surface irregularities of a non-hazardous nature, lulonthiy inspections are more in-depth than daily
inspections. Findings, as well as past and current conective actions, are recorded. Future observation schedules and longrange (permanent) corrective actions, such as additions to the Capital Improvement Program, are determined.

8. Project Description:

This project consists ofthe rehabilitation of approximately 63,400 square yards (sys)
of apron pavement. Thc project is divided into several phases in order to maintain
operational access to various areas ofthe airfield.
Phase I (General Aviation (GA) Ramp in front of new Fixed Base Operator (FBO))
includes new apron reconstruction consisting of 3,600 sys of 14 inch Portland
Cement Concrete (PCC) Pavement and 6,100 sys of 10 inch PCC Pavement.

 Phase I I (Terminal Ramp East) includes new apron reconstruction consisting of
12,000 sys of 12 inch PCC Pavement.
Phase III (Terminal Ramp West) includes new apron reconstruction consisting of
15,000 sys of 14 inch PCC Pavement.
Phase IV (GA Ramp East) includes new apron reconstruction consisting of 26,700
sys of 10 inch PCC Pavement.
This project includes the construction costs and construction administration
professional fees. The design was completed utilizing local Tax Incremental
Financing (TIF) funds and is not expected to be reimbursed with PFC funds.

9. Significant Contribution:
The terminal area has had several apron expansion projects in recent years. In between all
these projects is a section of bituminous pavement that was last overlaid in 1994. This past
rehabilitation project was designed to provide an extended life of six to ten years;
fortunately, the pavement has now lasted 20 years. The last 10 years, thc pavement has also
been subjected to higher volumes of heavy aircraft than ever anticipated. This heavy traffic
has paid a heavy toll on this pavement. The pavement is very poor and alligator cracking is
dominant. Although GYY has a proactive crack sealing program, this pavement is getting
to the point that it is difficult to seal these areas. Currently, trafflc is down which provides
an opportune time to reconstruct these pavements so as to not impact operations.
A portion of the general aviation apron pavement (Phase 1) was originally designed for
small general aviation aircraft and abuts the existing T-Hangar area. The existing pavement
section consists of approximately 4-5" of bituminous pavement on 6" of compacted
aggregate. With the construction of the B-Coleman FBO Facility and Hangar, increased
traffic from heavier aircraft will only accelerate the continued degradation of this
pavement. This section along with the other sections has a Pavement Condition Index (PCI)
rating of 32 to 57 which is Very Poor to Poor. These pavements need to be reconstructed in
order to avoid potential failure that could result in damage to aircraft.
According to the Pavement Condition Report, Pavement sections 3005 (Terminal Ramp)
and 3125 (FBO Ramp) had PCI range ratings of Very Poor, indicating intensive pavement
rehabilitation is needed to maintain serviceability. Six pavement sections including: 170
(Twy A-4), 180 (Twy A-2), 205 (Twy B), 3030 (Ramp), 3105(FBO Ramp), and 3110 (FBO
Ramp) had PCI range ratings of Poor, indicating that either major M&R is needed or that
near-term maintenance needs may be extensive in order to maintain serviceability. The
completion of this project will avoid potential failure that could result in damage to aircraft
or the creation of Foreign Object Debris (FOD), thereby enhancing the safety of the
Airport.
Pavement Condition Report excerpts included in Attachment F of this Application show
that the pavement is ranked as the worst pavement on the Airport. Information provided
in the Pavement Condition Report serves to further justify the need for this project as well
as provide evidence that this project will enhance safety at thc Airport.

10. Project Objective:

The project will prevent the formation of Foreign Object Damage (FOD) that could
damage aircraft engines, potentially causing them to fail and endanger aircraft,
operators, and passengers. While no FOD has yet been reported, the Pavement
Condition Report indicates the likelihood of this occurring. Therefore, this project
meets the PFC objective of preserving the safety of GYY's airfield as well as
preserving the capacity of the terminal area and general aviation aircraft parking
apron.

11. Project Justification:
The existing apron pavement is severely cracked and broken and has a Pavement
Condition Index (PCI) rating of Very Poor to Poor and is far beyond its useful life.
There are many areas that are approaching complete failure and repair and
maintenance of the pavement is beyond thc administration's capabilities. The
completion of this project will avoid potential failure that could result in damage to
aircraft or the creation of Foreign Object Debris (FOD), thereby enhancing the
safety ofthe Airport. Upon completion, this project will result with a pavement that
will have an extended life exceeding 20 years.

9. Significant Contribution:

Thc Master Plan is a study used to develop and evaluate facility recommendations
consistent with an airport's character and activity levels. Gary/Chicago Airport
Authority completed a Master Plan Update in 2001. The Gary/Chicago Master Plan
evaluated various airfield alternatives, with emphasis on those that address airport
design deficiencies. The current Master Plan and Airport Layout Plan is 13 years
old. With an anticipated planning process of two to four years, the Master Plan will
be between 15 and 17 years old and a substantial amount of the projects listed on
the current ALP will be complete.

B- 16

 Recent changes of Advisory Circular 5300-13A, which relates to thc F"AA standards
and recommendations for airport design, and other changes that have occurred in
advisory circulars since last Master Plan Update also need to be considered.

Gary/Chicago Airport Authority completed a Master Plan Update in 2001 that
evaluated various airfield alternatives, with emphasis on those that address airport
design deficiencies. With an anticipated planning process of two to four years, the
Master Plan will be between 15 and 17 years old and a substantial amount of the
projects listed on the 2001 ALP will be complete. An update of the Master Plan is
necessary in order to make facility recommendations consistent with the airport's
current activity levels and to consider changes to FAA standards and
recommendations for airport design that have occurred since 2001.
The Master Plan Update will also take into consideration the City-wide Master
Planning and Land Development program being implemented by the Public Private
Partnership (P3). This effort will provide for a more comprehensive area-wide land
use plan to ensure parallel growth and compatibility.

Re:

Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) Application 15-27-C-OO-ORD
Chicago O'Hare International Airport (O'Hare)
Gary/Chicago International Airport (Gary)

Dear [GREETING],

On August 1, 2014, the City of Cfiicago distributed a letter notifying air carriers at O'Hare
International Airport (O'Hare) of tfie City's intent to file PFC Application 14-27-C-OO-ORD for
autfiority to impose a PFC at O'Hare and to use PFC revenue for new projects at Gary/Ctiicago
International Airport (Gary). Tfie City held a meeting on September 5, 2014 and presented these
projects to air earners and foreign air carriers operating at O'Hare, after which the carriers had a
period to provide comments and certification of agreement or disagreement. The City
subsequently determined that not all air carriers and foreign air carriers providing
scheduled service at O'Hare received the initial notification letter. Therefore, the City has
elected to withdraw PFC Application 14-27-C-OO-ORD and expand the consultation to
include all necessary carriers.
The City is restarting the PFC airline consultation process with the distribution of this notice. The
remainder of information regarding the projects for which the City is seeking PFC authority
contained herein is identicai to the information provided in the August 1, 2014 notification letter.
There have been no changes to the scope or cost of the projects. Carriers who have already
submitted letters certifying agreement and comments as a result of the initial consultation have
the opportunity to submit new certification letters during the re-consultation process. If these
carriers choose not to do so, their initial certifications and associated comments will be included
in the new PFC Application 15-27-C-OO-ORD.

10.0 10 WK.sT zi;:.\!Ki-: no.AO, p.o. BOX oiii -i-J. ruic.AGO. u.i.i .NOI.'^ SOGOH

 In accordance with Section 158.23 of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 158, the City of
Chicago (City) hereby provides written notice of its intent to file an application with the Federal
Aviation Administration for authority under provisions of the United States Code (49 USC §
40117) to impose a passenger facility charge at O'Hare, and to use passenger facility charge
revenue for new projects at Gary. This notice includes information pursuant to section 128.23 of
FAR Part 158 and is provided to all air carriers and foreign air carriers having a significant
business interest at O'Hare. Through a 1995 compact between the City, the City of Gary, and
the Gary Board of Directors (the Compact), Gary has access to a small percentage of PFC
revenue collected at O'Hare. Pursuant to the Compact, the Airport Authority maintains a 12member Compact board of directors (separate from the Airport Board), the City and the City of
Gary each appoint five members and the states of Indiana and Illinois appoint one member each.
Additional information is provided in an attachment to this letter.
The City will hold a meeting to present these projects to air carriers and foreign air carriers
operating at O'Hare on Tuesday, June 16, 2015. The City will accept carrier comments, and
certifications of agreement or disagreement with the proposed projects, until July 16, 2015.
Application to Impose a PFC at O'Hare and Use PFC Revenue for New Projects at Garv
Section 158.23(a)(1). Description of Projects
The City intends to file an application to impose a PFC at O'Hare and to use PFC revenue for the
following projects at Gary:

Master Plan Update
This project consists of the planning efforts necessary to update the Master Plan and Airport
Layout Plan for Gary. The Master Plan is a study used to develop and evaluate facility
recommendations consistent with an airport's character and activity levels. Gary/Chicago Airport
Authority completed a Master Plan Update in 2001. The Gary/Chicago Master Plan evaluated
various airfield alternatives, with emphasis on those that address airport design deficiencies. The
current Master Plan and Airport Layout Plan is 13 years old. With an anticipated planning
process of two to four years, the Master Plan will be between 15 and 17 years old and a
substantial amount of the projects listed on the current ALP will be complete.
This update will also evaluate and include the recent changes of Advisory Circular 5300-13A,
which relates to the FAA standards and recommendations for airport design, and other changes
that have occurred in advisory circulars since 2001.

Apron Rehabilitation
This project consists of the rehabilitation of approximately 63,400 square yards (sys) of apron
pavement. The project is divided into several phases in order to maintain operational access to
various areas of the airfield.
This project includes the construction costs and construction administration professional fees.
The design was completed utilizing local Tax Incremental Financing (TIF) funds and is not

 expected to be reimbursed with PFC funds.
A portion of the general aviation apron pavement (Phase 1) was originally designed for small
general aviation aircraft and abuts the existing T-Hangar. The existing pavement section consists
of approximately 4-5" of bituminous pavement on 6" of compacted aggregate. With the
construction of the B. Coleman Fixed Base Operator (FBO) Facility and Hangar, increased traffic
from heavier aircraft may accelerate the continued degradation of this pavement. This section
along with the other sections has a Pavement Condition Index (PCI) rating of 32 to 57 which is
Very Poor to Poor. These pavements need to be reconstructed in order to avoid potential failure
that could result in damage to aircraft.
The total amount of PFC revenue currently estimated to be associated with this proposed impose
and use application is $11,125,000. The City anticipates that this entire amount will be approved
for a PFC at the $4.50 level as the Master Plan Update will preserve and enhance airspace
capacity and the Apron Rehabilitation will preserve and enhance air safety. Additional
information regarding the above projects, including the projects' scope, justification and financing
plan, is included in the exhibit to this letter and will be presented at the meeting on Tuesday, June
16, 2015.

Section 158.23 (a)(2). The PFC Level, Effective Date, Expiration Date and Total Revenue
PFC Level:

$4.50 per enplaned passenger at O'Hare

Charge Effective Date:

January 1, 2039

Estimated Charge Expiration Date^: February 1, 2039
Estimated Total PFC Revenue:

$6,628,490,989

The above proposed charge expiration date and total PFC revenue reflect the current and
pending impose approval and the total amount of PFC revenue as modified only by this proposed
impose and use application.

Reasons for Reguesting that Carriers Identified in this Section Not be Reguired to
Collect the PFC:
The number of passengers enplaned annually by this class
of carriers represents fewer than one percent of total enplanements at O'Hare.
The estimated annual PFC revenue from these carriers would be approximately
$4,034 as compared to the estimated PFC revenue of $130,893,933 from all other
carriers. In accordance with Section 158.11 of FAR Part 158, the City may
request of the FAA in its application for authority to impose PFCs, and in its
application for authority to use PFCs, that collection of PFCs by any class of air
carriers or foreign air carriers not be required if the number of passengers
enplaned by the carriers in this class constitutes no more than one percent of the
total number of passengers enplaned annually at the airport at which the PFC is
imposed. This is the case with the class of carriers identified herein.
This is the same class that was already approved for exemption by FAA (See
June 28, 1993 Record of Decision, p.26). Information on known carriers belonging
to the class has been updated to reflect the Department of Transportation (DOT)
Air Carrier Activity Information System Report for calendar year 2013, the most
recent report available to the City.

Section 158.23(a)(4). Date and Location of Air Carrier Consultation Meeting.
The City will hold a meeting to present the project to air carriers and foreign air carriers operating
at O'Hare:
Date: Tuesday, June 16, 2015
Time: 10:00am
Conference Room 1
Aviation Administration Building

 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Application to Impose a PFC at O'Hare and Use PFC Revenue for New Projects at
Garv/Chicaqo International Airport

Master Plan Update

Project Description:
This project consists ofthe planning efforts necessary to update the Master Plan and Airport
Layout Plan for the Gary/Chicago International Airport.
Project Justification/Significant Contribution:
The Master Plan is a study used to develop and evaluate facility recommendations consistent
with an airport's character and activity levels. Gary/Chicago Airport Authority completed a
Master Plan Update in 2001. The Gary/Chicago Master Plan evaluated various airfield
alternatives, with emphasis on those that address airport design deficiencies. The current
Master Plan and Airport Layout Plan is 13 years old. With an anticipated planning process of
two to four years, the Master Plan will be between 15 and 17 years old and a substantial
amount of the projects listed on the current ALP will be complete.
This update will also evaluate and include the recent changes of Advisory Circular 5300-13A,
which relates to the FAA standards and recommendations for airport design, and other changes
that have occurred in advisory circulars since 2001.
Project Objective:
This project will preserve and enhance the capacity of the national airspace system by planning
for future development as needed to accommodate demand.

 Apron Rehabilitation
Project Description:
This project consists of the rehabilitation of approximately 63,400 square yards (sys) of apron
pavement. The project is divided into several phases in orderto maintain operational access to
various areas of the airfield. Exhibit B shows the area and location of the apron rehabilitation
project.
Phase I (General Aviation (GA) Ramp in front of new Fixed Base Operator (FBO)) includes new
apron reconstruction consisting of 3,600 sys of 14 inch Portland Cement Concrete (PCC)
Pavement and 6,100 sys of 10 inch PCC Pavement
Phase II (Terminal Ramp East) includes new apron reconstruction consisting of 12,000 sys of
12 inch PCC Pavement.
Phase III (Terminal Ramp West) includes new apron reconstruction consisting of 15,000 sys of
14 inch PCC Pavement.
Phase IV (GA Ramp East) includes new apron reconstruction consisting of 26,700 sys of 10
inch PCC Pavement.
This project includes the construction costs and construction administration professional fees.
The design was completed utilizing local Tax Incremental Financing (TIF) funds and is not
expected to be reimbursed with PFC funds.
Project Justification/Significant Contribution:
A portion of the general aviation apron pavement (Phase 1) was originally designed for small
general aviation aircraft and abuts the existing T-Hangar area. The existing pavement section
consists of approximately 4-5" of bituminous pavement on 6" of compacted aggregate. With the
construction of the B-Coleman FBO Facility and Hangar, increased traffic from heavier aircraft
will only accelerate the continued degradation of this pavement. This section along with the
other sections has a Pavement Condition Index (PCI) rating of 32 to 57 which is Very Poor to
Poor. These pavements need to be reconstructed in order to avoid potential failure that could
result in damage to aircraft.
Project Objective:
The project will prevent the formation of Foreign Object Damage (FOD) that could damage
aircraft engines, potentially causing them to fail and endanger aircraft, operators and
passengers. Therefore, this project meets the PFC objective of preserving the safety of Gary's
airfield as well as preserving the capacity of the terminal area and general aviation aircraft
parking apron.

For Authority to Impose a Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) at Chicago O'Hare International
Airport and to Use PFC Revenue for New Projects at Gary/Chicago International Airport
Notice and Opportunity for Public Comment
The Gity of Chicago, Illinois proposes to file an application with the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) to impose a Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) at Ghicago O'Hare
International Airport (O'Hare) and use PFC revenue for new projects at Gary/Chicago
International Airport under the provisions of the Aviation Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of
1990, as amended (49 USC § 40117), and part 150 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR
part 158). This notice is published in accordance with 14 CFR § 158.24.
DATES: Comments must be received on or before Saturday, July 18, 2015.
ADDRESS:
Comments may be mailed to Michael Zonsius, City of Chicago - Department of
Aviation, 10510 West Zemke Road, Chicago, IL 60666. See item (viii) below.
The following information is provided in accordance with 14 CFR § 158.24(b)(1):
(i) A description of the projects ttie public agency is considering for funding by PFC's:
Master Plan Update
This project consists of the planning efforts necessary to update the Master Plan and Airport
Layout Plan for Gary. The Master Plan is a study used to develop and evaluate facility
recommendations consistent with an airport's character and activity levels. Gary/Chicago Airport
Authority completed a Master Plan Update in 2001. The Gary/Chicago Master Plan evaluated
various airfield alternatives, with emphasis on those that address airport design deficiencies.
Apron Rehabilitation
This project consists of the rehabilitation of approximately 63,400 square yards (sys) of apron
pavement. The project is divided into several phases in order to maintain operational access to
various areas ofthe airfield.
This project includes the construction costs and construction administration professional fees.
The design was completed utilizing local Tax Incremental Financing (TIF) funds and is not
expected to be reimbursed with PFC funds.
(ii) A brief justification for each project the public agency is considering for funding by PFC's:
Master Plan Update
The current Master Plan and Airport Layout Plan is 13 years old. With an anticipated planning
process of two to four years, the Master Plan will be between 15 and 17 years old and a
substantial amount of the projects listed on the current ALP will be complete.
This update will also evaluate and include the recent changes of Advisory Circular 5300-13A,
which relates to the FAA standards and recommendations for airport design, and other changes
that have occurred in advisory circulars since 2001.

 Apron Rehabilitation
A portion of the general aviation apron pavement (Phase 1) was originally designed for small
general aviation aircraft and abuts the existing T-Hangar. The existing pavement section consists
of approximately 4-5" of bituminous pavement on 6" of compacted aggregate. With the
construction of the B. Coleman Fixed Base Operator (FBO) Facility and Hangar, increased traffic
from heavier aircraft may accelerate the continued degradation of this pavement. This section
along with the other sections has a Pavement Condition Index (PCI) rating of 32 to 57 which is
Very Poor to Poor. These pavements need to be reconstructed in order to avoid potential failure
that could result in damage to aircraft.
(iii) The PFC Level for each project:
$4.50 per enplaned passenger
(iv) The estimated total PFC revenue the public agency will use for each project:
Master Plan Update $1,000,000
Apron Rehabilitation $10,125,000
(v) The proposed charge effective date for the application or notice of intent:
January 1, 2039
(vi) The estimated charge expiration date for the application or notice of intent:
February 1, 2039
(vii) The estimated total PFC revenue the public agency will collect for the application or notice of
intent:
$11,125,000

PROJECT INFORMATION
Application to Impose a PFC at O'Hare and Use PFC Revenue for New Projects at
Gary/Chicago International Airport

Master Plan Update
Project Description:
This project will consist of updating the Gary/Chicago International Airport's Master Plan
including the Airport Layout Plan (ALP). A new Airport Layout Plan will serve as a planning tool
for the airport depicting existing facilities and future facilities, designed to accommodate future
demand.
The Master Plan update will include a review of the Airport's inventory, an aviation demand
forecast (including commercial and air cargo industries), facility requirements analysis,
alternative developments to meet future demand and upgrade airfield facilities.

Project Justification/Significant Contribution:
The Master Plan is a study used to develop and evaluate facility recommendations consistent
with an airport's character and activity levels. Gary/Chicago Airport Authonty completed a
Master Plan Update in 2001 that evaluated various airfield alternatives, with emphasis on those
that address airport design deficiencies. With an anticipated planning process of two to four
years, the Master Plan will be between 15 and 17 years old and a substantial amount of the
projects listed on the 2001 ALP will be complete. An update of the Master Plan is necessary in
order to make facility recommendations consistent with the airport's current activity levels and to
consider changes to FAA standards and recommendations for airport design that have occurred
since 2001.
The Master Plan Update will also take into consideration the City-wide Master Planning and
Land Development program being implemented by the Public Private Partnership (P3). This
effort will provide for a more comprehensive area-wide land use plan to ensure parallel growth
and compatibility.

Project Objective:
The Master Plan Update project will preserve and enhance the capacity ofthe national airspace
system by planning for future development as needed to accommodate demand.

 Apron Rehabilitation
Project Description:
This project consists of the rehabilitation of approximately 63,400 square yards (sys) of apron
pavement. The project is divided into several phases in order to maintain operational access to
various areas of the airfield. Exhibit B shows the area and location of the apron rehabilitation
project.
Phase I (General Aviation (GA) Ramp in front of new Fixed Base Operator (FBO)) includes new
apron reconstruction consisting of 3,600 sys of 14 inch Portland Cement Concrete (PCC)
Pavement and 6,100 sys of 10 inch PCC Pavement.
Phase II (Terminal Ramp East) includes new apron reconstruction consisting of 12,000 sys of
12 inch PCC Pavement.
Phase III (Terminal Ramp West) includes new apron reconstruction consisting of 15,000 sys of
14 inch PCC Pavement.
Phase IV (GA Ramp East) includes new apron reconstruction consisting of 26,700 sys of 10
inch PCC Pavement.
This project includes the construction costs and construction administration professional fees.
The design was completed utilizing local Tax Incremental Financing (TIF) funds and is not
expected to be reimbursed with PFC funds.

Project Justification/Significant Contribution:
The existing apron pavement is severely cracked and broken and has a Pavement Condition
Index (PCI) rating of Very Poor to Poor and is far beyond its useful life. There are many areas
that are approaching complete failure and repair and maintenance of the pavement is beyond
the administration's capabilities. The completion of this project will avoid potential failure that
could result in damage to aircraft or the creation of Foreign Object Debris (FOD), thereby
enhancing the safety of the Airport. Upon completion, this project will result with a pavement
that will have an extended life exceeding 20 years.

C - 36

 The terminal area has had several apron expansion projects in recent years. In between all
these projects is a section of bituminous pavement that was last overlaid in 1994. This past
rehabilitation project was designed to provide an extended life of six to ten years; fortunately,
the pavement has now lasted 20 years. The last 10 years, the pavement has also been
subjected to higher volumes of heavy aircraft than ever anticipated. This heavy traffic has paid a
heavy toll on this pavement. The pavement is very poor and alligator cracking is dominant.
Although GYY has a proactive crack sealing program, this pavement is getting to the point that it
is difficult to seal these areas. Currently, traffic is down which provides an opportune time to
reconstruct these pavements so as to not impact operations.
A portion of the general aviation apron pavement (Phase 1) was originally designed for small
general aviation aircraft and abuts the existing T-Hangar area. The existing pavement section
consists of approximately 4-5" of bituminous pavement on 6" of compacted aggregate. With the
construction of the B-Coleman FBO Facility and Hangar, increased traffic from heavier aircraft
will only accelerate the continued degradation of this pavement. This section along with the
other sections has a Pavement Condition Index (PCI) rating of 32 to 57 which is Very Poor to
Poor. These pavements need to be reconstructed in order to avoid potential failure that could
result in damage to aircraft.
According to the Pavement Condition Report, Pavement sections 3005 (Terminal Ramp) and
3125 (FBO Ramp) had PCI range ratings of Very Poor, indicating intensive pavement
rehabilitation is needed to maintain serviceability. Six pavement sections including: 170 (Twy A4), 180 (Twy A-2), 205 (Twy B), 3030 (Ramp), 3105(FBO Ramp), and 3110 (FBO Ramp) had
PCI range ratings of Poor, indicating that either major M&R is needed or that near-term
maintenance needs may be extensive in order to maintain serviceability. The completion of this
project will avoid potential failure that could result in damage to aircraft or the creation of
Foreign Object Debris (FOD), thereby enhancing the safety of the Airport.
A Pavement Condition Report shows the pavement is ranked as the worst pavement on the
Airport. Information provided in the Pavement Condition Report serves to further justify the
need for this project as well as provide evidence that this project will enhance safety at the
Airport.

Project Objective:
The project will prevent the formation of Foreign Object Damage (FOD) that could damage
aircraft engines, potentially causing them to fail and endanger aircraft, operators, and
passengers. While no FOD has yet been reported, the Pavement Condition Report indicates the
likelihood of this occurring. Therefore, this project meets the PFC objective of preserving the
safety of GYY's airfield as well as preserving the capacity of the terminal area and general
aviation aircraft parking apron.

(iv)

Reasons for Requesting that Carriers Identified in this Section Not be Reguired
to Collect the PFC: The number of passengers enplaned annually by this class
of carriers represents fewer than one percent of total enplanements at O'Hare.
The estimated annual PFC revenue from these carriers would be approximately
$4,034 as compared to the estimated PFC revenue of $130,893,933 from all
other carriers. In accordance with Section 158.11 of FAR Part 158, the City may
request of the FAA in its application for authority to impose PFCs, and in its
application for authority to use PFCs, that collection of PFCs by any class of air
carriers or foreign air carriers not be required if the number of passengers
enplaned by the carriers in this class constitutes no more than one percent ofthe
total number of passengers enplaned annually at the airport at which the PFC is
imposed. This is the case with the class of carriers identified herein.

This is the same class that was already approved for exemption by FAA (See June 28,
1993 Record of Decision, p.26). Information on known carriers belonging to the class has been
updated to reflect the Department of Transportation (DOT) Air Carrier Activity Information
System Report for calendar year 2013, the most recent report available to the City.

Re: ORD - Passenger Facility Charge Application

Dear Mr. Zonsius:
United Continental Holdings, Inc. ("United") appreciates the opportunity to comment on
the referenced application to be filed by the City of Chicago - Chicago Department of
Aviation ("CDA") to impose and use Passenger Facility Charges ("PFCs") under Title 14,
CFR, Part 158 at Chicago O'Hare Intemational Airport ("Airport").
United hereby submits its written Certification of Agreement/Disagreement as to those
proposed projects referenced in the CDA's official notice dated August 1, 2014 and as
presented and discussed at the September 5, 2014 consultation meeting under Application
14-27-C-OO-ORD.
It is our understanding that PFC eligible projects, by statute, are those that preserve or
enhance the safety, capacity, or security of the national transportation system; reduce
airport noise or mitigate noise impacts; or enhance competition among air carriers.
Further, we interpret the requirement that PFC-funded projects must qualify as AIPeligible projects, mandating that PFC-funded projects be limited to those programs for
which an immediate and justifiable need can be demonstrated or substantiated. Projects
that cannot be justified based upon an immediate and justifiable need should be
eliminated from the proposed PFC application and deferred for PFC consideration until
such time as a need can be demonstrated
With this as background. United offers the following comments regarding the projects
proposed for PFC funding by the CDA:

Subject:

Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) Application 14-27-C-OO-ORD

Dear Mr. Zonsius:
Pursuantto 14 CFR Part 158, Section 158.23, this letter and attachment hereto shall serve
as American Airlines' ("American") Certification of Agreement or Disagreement with
respect to the projects included in the subject PFC application to be filed by the City of
Chicago - Chicago Department of Aviation ("CDA").
PFC-ellgible projects, by statute, are those that preserve or enhance the safety, capacity,
or security of the national air transportation system, reduce airport noise or mitigate airport
noise impacts, or enhance competition among air carriers. In addition, American interprets
the regulations such that PFC-funded projects are to be limited to those programs for
which a near term and justifiable need can be demonstrated. Accordingly, American
Airlines' certification(s) to the proposed PFC program is guided by these principles.
Also, American notes that PFCs are available as an additional funding source for eligible
airport projects, along w'Ah other funding sources, such as the Airport Improvement
Program (AIR Program). American's certification of agreement on any specific project is
conditioned on the CDA applying for AIP funding first (if eligible), with PFC funds used to
fund the local share accordingly.
We look forward to working with the CDA in developing and maintaining airport facilities
that will meet the needs of the traveling public and the air carriers serving Chicago O'Hare
International Airport ("Airport").
Sincerely,

Attachment

Re: Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) Application 15-27-C-OO-ORD
Chicago O'Hare International Airport (O'Hare)
Gary/Chicago International Airport (Gary)
Dear Sirs,
LOT Polish Airlines S.A. (LOT) have been informed by the Chicago Department of Aviation / City of Chicago letter dated May
15th, 2015 that the City of Chicago intends to file an application to impose a Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) at O'Hare Airport
in Chicago and use PFC revenue for two projects at Gary/Chicago International Airport (Gary). The projects at Gary have been
described in an attachment to the above mentioned letter ( "Project Information: Application to Impose a PFC at O'Hare and
use PFC Revenue for New Projects at Gary/Chicago International Airport").
Despite of the fact that both of the above mentioned airports forming the Chicago Airport System serve scheduled passenger
traffic and have published relevant airport charges tariffs scheduled applicable for all carriers and passengers using the above
mentioned airports, only the PFC collected at Chicago O'Hare would be used for a financial support for Gary projects. In
addition, the several air carriers operating at Gary have been identified as not required to collect the PFC.
During the consultations LOT has been informed that, following PFC Regulation Part 158.13, the PFC revenue may be used for
such projects as in case of Gary. LOT has also been informed that through the 1995 compact between the City, the City of
Gary, and the Gary Board of Directors, Gary has access to a small percentage of PFC revenue collected at O'Hare and all of
the necessary approvals by the FAA for the use of PFCs at Gary have been obtained by the City of Chicago and projects at
Gary have been approved for PFC funding by the FAA.
With full respect to the regulations and procedures in force I kindly inform you that we are not sure whether in case of the
above mentioned two Gary Projects, the charge (PFC) would be imposed on a non-discriminatory basis as the Chicago
Midway and the Chicago Gary airports seem not to participate in the charge scheme.
Therefore I would IfKe to kindly inform you that LOT Polish Airlines S,A, cannot support the Project.

Re: Proposed 14-27-C-OO-ORD Application for Passenger Facility Changes (PFC)
Dear Mr. Zonsius,
Pursuant to provisions of 14 CFR 158, this letter serves as Alaska Airtines written
Certification of Agreement or Disagreement with the plan to impose and use PFC
collections at Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD).
Alaska Airtines certification to the proposed PFC program at airports is guided by the
following policy interpretation:
o

PFC eligible projects are those that preserve or enhance safety, security, or
capacity, reduce airport noise or mitigate airport noise impacts, or enhance
competition among air carriers
o PFC funds are collected in the form of a charge applied only to the passenger
tickets sold, and therefore PFCs should be used for supplemental CIP funding
to the extent that these revenues are proportionate to the passenger carriers'
allocable share of those project costs
o PFCs are to be utilized to fund the local share after other funding sources such
as the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) have been sought
o Alaska Airtines' interpretation of Part 158 is that projects funded by PFC
collections are to be restricted to those programs which a near term and
justifiable need can be demonstrated
Alaska Airtines' agreement, if any, is contingent upon the estimates, scope and
descnption of the projects as presented. In addition, any agreement under this PFC
consultation process is not to be construed as approval or disapproval of these or
related projects or financing plans under any present or future agreement with the
Chicago O'Hare International Airport. Any agreement under this PFC consultation
process shall not be construed as an invalidation of any nghts under any Use or
Lease agreements to review and/or approve these projects and financing related to
these projects.
The statements below are in response to the matenals that were sent to the airtines
on May 15, 2015, and discussed at the June 16"^, 2015 consultation meeting:

Response to Air Carrier C o m m e n t s
On August 1, 2014, and May 15, 2015, the City published written notices and opportunities for air carrier
comment on this proposed application under 14 CFR § 158.23. Airlines not providing comment signify a
Certification of Agreement. If a carrier fails to provide the public agency with timely acknowledgement of
the notice or timely certification of agreement or disagreement with the proposed project, the carrier is
considered to have certified its agreement under 14 CFR § 158.23(c)3.
Air Carrier Response to September 5, 2014 Consultation
Two carriers (United and American) returned a Certification of Agreement after the Air Carrier
Consultation Meeting, held September 5, 2014. United and American Airlines provided comment along
with the Certification of Agreement:
U n i t e d / A m e r i c a n C o m m e n t : "We submit that PFC funding for this project should be equitably split
between Chicago O'Hare (ORD) and Chicago Midway (MDW) airports."
City Response: There is no requirement under PFC regulations or the Chicago-Gary Compact that an
equitable share of PFCs generated at Chicago Midway International Airport (MDW) be used for the
projects in this Application. At this time, the Chicago Department of Aviation (CDA) does not intend to
pursue PFC authority to use MDW PFCs for an allocable portion of these projects. If, however, CDA does
apply in the future for PFC authority for a share of these projects at MDW, the authority at ORD will
concurrently be amended downward by the appropriate amount.
Air Carrier Response to Second Consultation held June 16, 2015
After the Air Carrier Consultation Meeting held June 16, 2015, two additional carriers provided letters.
Alaska Airlines provided a letter of agreement and LOT Polish Airlines stated in a letter that they cannot
support the project.
LOT Polish Comment: "With full respect to the regulations and procedures in force I kindly inform you
that we are not sure whether in case of the two Gary Projects, the charge (PFC) would be imposed on a
non-discriminatory basis as the Chicago Midway and the Chicago Gary airports seem not to participate in
the charge scheme."
City Response:
The projects included in this PFC Application are eligible to receive PFC collect and use authority for
the following reasons:
PFC Regulation Part 158.13 states:
"PFC revenue, including any interest earned after such revenue has been remitted to a public
agency, may be used only to finance the allowable costs of approved projects at any airport the
public agency controls."
Through a 1995 compact between the City, the City of Gary, and the Gary Board of Directors (the
Compact), Gary has access to a small percentage of PFC revenue collected at O'Hare. Pursuant to the

 Compact, the Gary Regional Airport Authority maintains a 12-member Compact board of directors
(separate from the Airport Board), the City and the City of Gary each appoint five members and the
states of Indiana and Illinois appoint one member each.
Section 25-10(b) of the Compact states:
"Within 180 days following the Effective Date, the City of Chicago shall file a passenger facility
charge application with the FAA requesting authorization to use a portion of the passenger facility
charges collected by the City of Chicago at the Chicago Airports for purposes of financing any or
all of the Capital Projects described in Exhibit B to this Compact, and annually for eligible
passenger facility charge projects as may from time to time in the future become part of Gary
Regional Airport's Capital Plan as approved by the Board, which Capital Projects are compatible
with Gary Regional Airport's function as a reliever airport for the Chicago Airports. Following
receipt of all necessary approvals from the FAA, the City of Chicago shall have the exclusive power
to direct the planning, design, construction, financing and implementation of any such Capital
Projects to be financed with passenger facility charges remitted to the City of Chicago in such
fiscal years. Subject to FAA approval, the amount of passenger facility charges used by the City of
Chicago for Capital Projects at the Gary Regional Airport in any fiscal year pursuant to this
subsection (b) shall not exceed one and one-half percent of the aggregate passenger facility
charges collected by the City of Chicago at the Chicago Airports. The City of Chicago shall have all
necessary powers to satisfy the passenger facility charge assurances made to the FAA in
connection with any such applications. The City of Gary and the Gary Regional Airport Authority
shall enter into all agreements and assurances and take all other actions that may be necessary to
obtain and maintain FAA approval for the use of passenger facility charges as contemplated in
this subsection (b).
All of the necessary approvals by the FAA for the use of PFCs at GYY have been obtained by the City
of Chicago, and projects at GYY have been approved for PFC funding at O'Hare, which did not include
PFC Revenue generated by Chicago Midway, by the FAA in the following PFC Applications:
•

01-12-C-00-ORD

.
•

03-15-C-OO-ORD
06-19-C-OO-ORD

Therefore, PFCs are available to fund the Capital Projects included in this application up to an annual
amount equal to 1.5 percent of the total PFC Revenues from the Chicago Airports and up to a total
amount equal to the amount shown in the financing plan for each project included in the notification
letter dated May 15, 2015.
There is no requirement under PFC regulations or the Chicago-Gary Compact that an equitable share
of PFCs generated at Chicago Midway International Airport (MDW) be used for the projects in this
Application. At this time, the Chicago Department of Aviation (CDA) does not intend to pursue PFC
authority to use MDW PFCs for an allocable portion of these projects. If, however, CDA does apply in
the future for PFC authority for a share of these projects at MDW, the authority at ORD will
concurrently be amended downward by the appropriate amount.
Regarding nondiscriminatory rate-setting, PFC Regulation Part 158.29(a) states:
(a) Authority to impose a PFC.
(1) An application to impose a PFC will be approved in whole or in part only after a
determination that -

E-12

 (i)

The amount and duration of the PFC will not result in revenue that exceeds amounts

necessary to finance the project;
(ii) The project will achieve the objectives and criteria set forth in §158.15 except for
those projects approved under §158.18;
(iii) If a PFC level above $3 is being approved, the project meets the criteria set forth in
§158.17;
(iv) The collection process, including any request by the public agency not to require a
class of carriers to collect PFCs, is reasonable, not arbitrary, nondiscriminatory, and
otherwise in compliance with the law;
(v)

The public agency has not been found to be in violation of 49 U.S.C. 47524 and
47526;
(vi) The public agency has not been found to be in violation of 49 U.S.C. 47107(b)
governing the use of airport revenue;
(vii) If the public agency has not applied for authority to use PFC revenue, a finding that
there are alternative uses of the PFC revenue to ensure that such revenue will be
used on approved projects; and
(viii) If applicable, the public agency has submitted a competition plan in accordance with
§158.19.

The PFC charged on PFC-eligible enplanements at the Airport meets the criteria of nondiscriminatory
in that all carriers at the Airport, other than the class of carriers that is excluded, collects the $4.50 PFC
on all PFC-eligible enplanements
Therefore, the projects included in this PFC Application are PFC-eligible under Federal PFC
Regulations and PFCs are included in the financial plan for these projects based on the authority and
reasoning outlined above.

2.2 Distress Types and Frequency
The inspectors surveyed approximately 810,000 ft^ of AC pavement. The frequency of each
distress type is shown in Table 2-2. The most common distress types were longitudinal and
transverse (L&T) cracking, weathering and alligator cracking. L&T cracking and weathering are
climate-related distresses, and alligator cracking is a load-related distress.

Distress Identification

This chapter describes pavement distress types commonly identified during airport PCI inspections.
Rigid Pavement Distress
Longitudinal, Transverse & Diagonal Crack/ng
LTD cracking is often a result of load or
temperature deformations. External loads
cause flexure. Temperature changes can cause
curling. When any of these stresses exceed the
slab strength, cracking occurs.
LTD cracking is recorded at low, medium, or
high severity, depending on the width of crack
opening and degree of deterioration.
At low severity, a crack is less than 1/8 inch
wide with little spalling, and no corrective
action is indicated. At medium severity, LTD
cracks can be up to 1 inch wide with moderate
spalling and should be repaired using
procedures similar to joint sealing. At high
severity, cracks exceed 1 inch in width and may
be severely spalled. High-severity LTD cracking
is evidence of serious load failure, and
correction may require patching or slab
replacement. If distress occurs in several
adjacent slabs at medium or high severity,
major rehabilitation of that area is indicated.
A slab divided into four or more pieces is said to
be "divided" or "shattered." Shattered slab is a
separate distress category and indicates a
significant structural failure. A shattered slab
has lost its ability to distribute loads. Shattered
slabs are rated in three severities, but the
recommended action in any case is slab
replacement.

 )RPR
Shrinkage Crack/ng

Durability Cracking

Shrinkage cracks are small, non-working cracks
visible at the pavement surface but not
penetrating the full depth of concrete.
Shrinkage cracks most commonly occur shortly
after construction due to concrete shrinkage
during the curing process.

Durability cracking (D-cracking) is caused by
environmental factors, the most common being
freeze/thaw. D-cracking usually appears as
either a pattern of hairline cracks running
parallel to a joint or crack, or in a corner, where
water tends to collect. D-cracking eventually
leads to disintegration of the pavement,
creating foreign object damage (FOD) potential.

Shrinkage cracks are usually so small that they
are not visible until staining or loss of material
at crack edges begins to take place. Shrinkage
cracks do not represent structural weakness,
and no corrective action is prescribed.

At low severity, D-cracking is evident, but no
disintegration has occurred. Medium severity is
evident over a significant area of the slab, and
some disintegration and FOD potential exist.
High-severity D-cracking is evidenced by
extensive cracking with loose and missing
pieces and significant FOD potential.

Pavement Condition Report, Gary/Chicago International Airport
F . -^n

138

 RPR
Joint Spall and Corner Spall
Spalls at slab joints and corners are caused by
excessive internal stress in the pavement.
Spalls occur when these stresses exceed the
shear strength of the concrete.
Spalling usually results from thermal expansion
during hot weather when slabs push and
expand against one another. If the joints are
filled with incompressible material, such as
sand, stresses can become severe, causing
spalls. Spalling can be reduced significantly by
maintenance of joint sealant.
Spall repair requires patching. The extent and
severity of spalling suggests the appropriate
action. At low severity, spalled concrete
remains securely in place in the slab. A lowseverity spall should be monitored closely for
further deterioration and should be patched
when spalled particles become loose, or during
the next scheduled patching activity. Mediumand high-severity spalls should be repaired
immediately to prevent FOD. Ifthe pavement
can be restored to serviceable condition, spalls
should be patched for long-term service. Ifthe
pavement is beyond repair, temporary patching
should be considered to control FOD.

Pavement Condition Report, Gary/Chicago International Airport

139

 RPR
Patches, Large and Small
Large and small patches, by PCI inspection
criteria, are distress conditions. Patches
indicate deterioration and aging of pavement
that contributes to shortened service life.
However, patching also indicates that pavement
is being maintained.
A patch that is performing well and shows no
outward distress is recorded at low severity,
and no corrective action is required. Mediumseverity patches are serviceable but are
beginning to deteriorate. Maintenance or
replacement is indicated. At high severity,
replacement is indicated.
By definition, small patches are smaller than 5
square feet in surface area, and they usually
result from spall repair at slab joints and
corners.
Large patches also may be the result of spall
repair, but they often indicate more serious
deficiencies, such as corner breaks or other fulldepth failure smaller than panel size.

Pavement Condition Report, Gary/Chicago International Airport

 )RPR
Joint Seal Damage
When joint sealant is in perfect condition (no
damage), there is no distress.
At low severity, at least 10 percent ofthe
sealant is debonded but still in contact with the
joint edges. Medium-severity joint seal damage
is recorded when at least 10 percent of the
sealant has visible gaps smaller than 1/8 inch
and is an indicator that replacement should be
programmed as soon as is practical. In the
meantime, aggressive inspection and sustaining
maintenance is recommended to minimize
subsurface damage from moisture penetration.
At high severity, visible gaps exceed 1/8 inch,
and the amount and degree of joint seal
damage typically requires complete removal
and replacement ofthe existing sealant.
On serviceable pavement, deteriorated joint
sealant should be repaired or replaced to
preserve pavement and subgrade integrity and
prolong service life. The issue is not so clear-cut
with unserviceable pavement. Pavement that
can be restored to serviceable condition by
maintenance activities such as patching and
joint seal repair, or by slab replacement, should
be so maintained as long as the process is costeffective. However, when age and condition
preclude economical return to serviceable
condition by such means, joint seal repair would
no longer be cost-effective and should be
suspended except for an interim maintenance
program to control FOD potential.

Flexible Pavement Distress
Longitudinal & Trans. Cracking
L&T cracks are caused by age, construction, and
subsurface conditions. Age-related cracking
occurs as oxidizing pavement loses components
to the atmosphere and becomes more brittle.
Consistent application of seal coats can help to
prevent age-related cracks.
Construction-related cracking often develops
along paving joints. Ensuring that joints are
made when both sides are still hot, and near
the same temperature, is one of the best ways
to mitigate this potential problem.
Seasonal movement caused by changes in
subsurface moisture or temperature differences
also can cause pavement cracking. Asphalt
pavement placed over a PCC pavement or
cement stabilized base course may evidence
reflective cracking from the underlying material.
Wheel loads do not cause L&T cracks, although
traffic may worsen their condition.
Low-severity L&T cracks are less than % inch
wide, or if sealed with suitable filler material in
satisfactory condition can be any width less
than 3 inches, if they are not spalled.
Maintenance usually is not indicated for lowseverity cracking. Moderately spalled cracks
and cracks wider than % inch which are not
satisfactorily sealed are at medium severity.
Medium-severity cracks should be sealed with a
high-quality crack filling material. Severely
spalled cracks and cracks wider than 3 inches
are at high severity. High-severity L&T cracks
normally require patching.

Alligator

Cracking

Alligator cracks are a series of interconnected
load-related cracks caused by fatigue of the
asphalt surface. Alligator cracking is a
significant structural distress and develops only
in places subject to traffic loads. These cracks
typically initiate at the bottom of the asphalt
layer and propagate upward. Once a fatigue
crack is visible at the surface, significant
damage has already occurred.
At low severity, alligator cracks are evidenced
by a series of parallel hairline cracks (usually in
a wheel path). Medium-severity alligator
cracking is a well-defined pattern of
interconnected cracks, and some spalling may
be present. High-severity alligator cracks have
lost aggregate interlock between adjacent
pieces, and the cracks may be severely spalled
with FOD potential. Most likely, the pieces will
move freely under traffic.
Alligator cracking is a serious structural failure
that cannot be repaired with sealant. The
proper repair is patching.

 )RPR
Raveling/Weathering

Rutting

Raveling and weathering are the wearing away
ofthe pavement surface. Failure can be caused
by the dislodging of aggregate particles or the
loss of asphalt binder. These distresses are
usually evident over large areas and may
indicate that the asphalt binder has hardened
significantly.

Ruts are localized areas of pavement having
elevations lower than the surrounding sections.

Raveling is the loss of coarse aggregate,
weathering is the loss of fine aggregate or
binder.
Raveling: At low severity, 5 to 20 coarse
aggregate particles are missing per square yard.
Medium severity is defined by 20 to 40 missing
coarse aggregate particles per square yard. At
high severity, more than 40 coarse aggregate
particles are missing per square yard, and the
top layer of aggregate has eroded away.

Rutting is due to base and subgrade
consolidation caused by excessive wheel loads
or poor compaction. Ruts indicate structural
failure and can cause hydroplaning.
At low severity, ruts have an average depth of %
to Yi inches. At medium severity, ruts have an
average depth of 34 to 1 inch. At high severity,
ruts have an average depth greater than 1 inch.
Patching is the appropriate repair for ruts.

Weathering: At low severity, edges of coarse
aggregate are exposed less than 1 mm. At
medium severity, loss of fine aggregate is
noticeable and edges of coarse aggregate are
exposed up to 6 mm (1/4 inch). High severity
weathering has edges of coarse aggregate
exposed > 6 mm, with considerable loss of fine
aggregate matrix and potential for loss of
coarse aggregate.

1995:
Section 5-5.

Purpose of Compact.

The purpose of this Compact is to create the

Authority as an interstate body politic and corporate under this Compact with the powers set
forth in this Compact to jointly oversee and support the Existing Airports as set forth in this
Compact, to jointly evaluate the Bi-State Region's need for additional Airport capacity, to jointly
coordinate ahd plan for the continued development, enhancement and operation of the Existing
Airports and the development of any New Regional Airport serving the Bi-State Region and to
assure the continued autonomous management and operation by the City of Chicago of the
Chicago Airports and the continued autonomous management and operation by the City of Gary
through the Gary Regional Airport Authority of the Gary Regional Airport.
Section 5-10. Findings.
'

(aj

The primary air tirade area served by the Existing Airports consists of eight

coiinties in Illinois (Cook. DiiPage. Grundy. Kane. Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will) and two
counties (Lake and Porter) in Indiana (the "Bi-State Region"). The Chicago Airports and the
Gary Regional Airport are the major airports serving the Bi-State Region and comprise the local
airport systein. Gary Regional Aiiport functions, and is designated, as a reliever airport for the
Chicago Airports.
(b)

Extensive, reliable air transportation service linking the Bi-State Region to the rest

of the nation and the world, enabling the Bi-State Region to participate fully in the national and
global economies, is critical to the continued economic development of the Bi-State Region. The
coordinated development ofthe local airport system, and any new airports that may be built as
part of the local airport system, is essential to provide facilities to meet this deinand efficiently
and effectively. Failure to establish a mechanism to coordinate the planning and development of
6

 [

f
the local airport system could result in the inability to make capacity improvements where they
can be implemented^ most efficiently to alleviate congestion and meet demand, in duplicative
development, or in the inability to meet the long-term air service needs of the Bi-State Region.
The best way to ensure the necessary coordination of fiirther airport development, while
recognizing the significant interests ofthe local govemmental bodies, is the creation of a bi-state
regional authority to oversee future development of the local airport system, while allowing the
continued operation of the Existing Airports by the respective local govemment ientities that now
operate them.
(c)

The City of Chicagb is the owner, operator and manager of the Chicago Airports.

f

Throughtiieefforts and leadership oftiieCity of Chicago, Chicago - O'Hare Intemational Airport
is the busiest airport in the world. The Chicago Airpprts serve a critical role in the nation's air
transportation system, and provide significant economic benefits to the Bi-State Region. The
City of Chicago has committed si^ificant resources to the development and operation of the
Chicago Airports and views the Chicago Airports as a significant mumcipal asset. It is in the
best interests of the City of Chicago and a public purpose, which this Compact is intended to
further, to ensure that (i) the Chicago Airports, retain their pre-eminent position as an engine for
economic growth and development of the City of Chicago, (ii) the City of Chicago's investment
in die Chicago Airports, and ancillary and intangible benefits accruing to the City^.of Chicago and
its citizensfromthe Chicago Airports be protected by the continued operation of the Chicago
Airports by the City of Chicago and (iii) the local airport system development policy be
responsive to the concerns of the City of Chicago and the City of Guy and not be promulgated
by any Person not experienced in the affairs of the Chicago Airports and the Gary Regional
Airport. The City of Gary benefitsfromthe continued operation of the Chicago Airports by the
City of Chicago. By establishing the Authority pursuant to this Compact, the mutual aviation
interests of both the City of Chicago and the City of Gary are best served.

 (d)

The City of Gary conti-ols Gary Regional AirporttiiroughtiieGary Regional

Airport Authority. The Gary Regional Airport Authority owns and operates Gary Regional
Airport. Gary Regional Airport has various capital development needs and the City of Gary and
the Gary Regional Airport Authority have insufficient resources to fimd the Capital Projects
needed to enable Gary Regional Airport to fimction effectiviely as a reliever airport for the
Chicago Airports. Development of Gary Regional Airport can help meet thc air transportation
needs of the Bi-State Region. Coordination by the Signatorieis of the development of Gary
Regional Airport jointly with the development of the Chicago Aiiports will promote the timely
implementation of capacity improvements to meet the air service needs of the Bi-State Region.
Development of Gary Regional Airport will provide substantial benefits to the Chicago Aiiports
by alleviating congestion at Chicago-O'Hare International Airport, reducing operational delays
and associated costs for air carriers ahd air travelers arid promoting the efficient use of the local
airport system. This Compact will facilitate the development of the facilities and operations at
Gary Regional Airport in coordination with the Chicago Airports.
(e)

Substantial benefits will accrue to the City of Chicago and to the City of Gaiy, and

to theiri/citizens. as the result of the provisions of this Compact that provide for the coordination
of airport development through the Authority ahd the funding bf certain airport development,
while allowing the continued management ahd operation of the Existing Airports in the local
airport system by the respective Signatories.,
(f)

Subject to the powers specifically granted to the Authority under this Compact,

the City of Chicago shall continue to itianage and operate the Chicago Airports in accordance
with the terms of the Existing Airport Agreements, and the City of Gary through the Gary
Regional Airport Authority shall continue to manage and operate the Gary Regional Airport, both
on the coordinated basis set forth in this Compa.ct. This Compact also directs the Signatories,
through the Authority, to plan for any future additional airport capacity needed on a basis
consistent with the interests of each Signatory. The establishment of the Authority and the
8

 r
L

}
niaintenance of the existing governance structures for the Existing Airports on a basis consistent
with the terms of this Compact will provide for the most efficient and effective method of

L
LJ

evaluating the need for a new Airport serving the Bi-State Region, and for planning for thc joint
development of any such Airport on a coordinated basis supported by a bi-state consensus.
(g)

The City of Chicago has recentiy completed ttie refmancing of the Chicago

Skyway and has undertaken a major capital improvement program for that toll bridge and
highway facility. The Chicago Skyway serves the Bi-State Region as a vital and effective ground
transportation link between Chicago and Gary and the Chicago Airports and Gary Regional
Airport.
(h)

Pursuant to authority provided by federal and state law, the City of Chicago and

the City of Gary are creating the Authority as an interstate body politic and coiporate .under the

RE: Categorical Exclusion for Apron Rehabilitation
Dear Airport Sponsor:
The purpose of this letter is to notify you that the project to rehabilitate the apron at the
Gary/Chicago Intemational Airport has been approved under the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA). The project includes fiill depth rehabilitation of the existing 101,500
square yard apron.
Under NEPA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is required to take into account
environmental consideration when authorizing or approving major actions. Based on the
review of the action described above, the undersigned has determined that the proposed
actions are specifically categorically excluded from further NEPA review. They fall
within the specific items identified in FA A Order 1050.1E, Paragraph 31 Oe (runways and
aprons), and are normally categorically excluded from the requirement for a formal
environmental assessment.
This transmittal is a notification that this project has been reviewed and cleared only for
purposes of NEPA review. This is not a notice of final project approval or funding.
Please contact me at (847) 294-7364 with any questions or concems.
Sincerely,

Bobb A. Beauchai?
Environmental Program Manager

APPENDIX 0 - CATEX Long Form
Checklist to Support an Environmental Finding of
Categorical Exclusion (CATEX)
This checklist documents consideration of environmental laws, regulations, and executive orders as they
apply to Federal actions. It is based on the guidance in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Order
5050.48, "National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Implementing Instructions for Airport Actions," FAA
Order 1050.1E, "Environmental Impacts: Policies and Procedures," and incorporates the Council on
Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations for implementing the NEPA, federal statutes and laws designed
to protect the Nation's resources.
The preparer of this checklist should have knowledge of the environmental features of the airport and
general potential impacts associated with the proposed development. Although some ofthe responses
may be obtained from the preparer's own knowledge and observations, previous environmental
documents and current agency correspondence should be cited.
