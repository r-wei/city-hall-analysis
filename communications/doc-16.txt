I support passage ofthe Ordinance'to provide reparations to survivors of torture by
the Chicago's police.
From 1972 to 1991, officers of the'Chicago Police Department systematically
tortured over 100 suspects, under the direction of Police Commander Jon Burge at
Area 2 and 3 police stations. In addition to beatings, individuals allege.d that they
were subjected to electric shocks; had plastic bags placed over their heads and
threatened with mock executions.
•?-i5,tHs'
Although Burge was convicted in federal court for perjury ahdlobstrij^GW©^^^^^
justice, neither he nor any of the de^tectives he supervised have been prosecuted for
committing torture.
Statutes of limitations not only prevent the ability to obtain justice for these crimes
but also financial reparations for survivors. International law strictly prohibits the
use of torture and other ill-treatmerit, and stipulates that governments are
responsible for investigating torture allegations; bringing criminal proceedings in
torture cases and compensating the victims.
It has been more than twenty years ^since these allegations of torture first came to
light. For all of that time, survivors and their family members have been denied
prosecutions of the crimes alleged and many have been denied reparations to make
them whole as required under international law. Now is the time to take steps to
make these survivors of torture and their families whole again. Please pass the
Reparations Ordinance for Chicago Pohce Torture Survivors to help take that step.

Dan King
