RE:

2014 Municipal Depository Compliance

As required by Section 2-32-400 of the Municipal Code, my office advertised in the
Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times inviting financial institutions not previously
designated, to apply for status as municipal depositories for the City and for the Board of
Education for the year 2014.
MB Financial Bank is the only bank that submitted a bid. The bid is available for review
upon request.
The current designated municipal depositories are those that were approved by City
Council on May 12, 2010.
This memorandum serves as notice per Section 2-32-400 of the Municipal Code.
