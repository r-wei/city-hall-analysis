Title:

Letter of support from Mark Wieder for reparations to victims
and family members of torture by Chicago Police
Department

Committee(s) Assignment:

 Chicago City Council
121 N LaSalle St #107A
Chicago, IL 60602
I support passage ofthe Ordinance to provide reparations to survivors of torture by the Chicago's
police:
I
- From 1972 to 1991, officers of the Chicago Police Department systematically tortured over 100
suspects, under the direction of Police Commander .Ion Burge at Area 2 and 3 police stations. In
addition to beatings, individuals alleged that they were subjected to electric shocks; had plastic bags
placed over their heads and threatened with mock executions.
i

- Although Burge was convicted in federal court for perjury and obstruction of justice, neither he nor
any of the detectives he supervised have been prosecuted for committing torture.
- Statutes of limitations not only prevent the ability to obtain justice for these crimes but also financial
reparations for survivors. International law strictly prohibits the use of torture and other ill-treatment,
and stipulates that governments are responsible tor investigating torture allegations; bringing criminal
proceedings in torture cases and compensating the victims.
I
- It has been more than twenty years since these allegations of torture first came to light. For all of that
time, survivors and their family members have been denied prosecutions of the crimes alleged and
many have been denied reparations to make (hcnr whole as required under international law. Now is the
time to take steps to make these survivors of torture and their families whole again. Please pass the
Reparations Ordinance for Chicago Police Torture Survivors to help take that step.
Sincerely,

j
