A redemption of 2015 Bonds shall be a redemption of the whole or of any part of
the Bonds from any funds available for that purpose in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture, provided, that there shall be no partial redemption of any 2015 Bond which would result
in the unredeemed portion not being of an Authorized Denomination. If less than all the 2015
Bonds are called for redemption under any provision of the Indenture permitting such partial
redemption, the particular 2015 Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee, in such
manner as the Trustee in its discretion may deem fair and appropriate (except when the 2015

amount of such 2015 Bond. New 2015 Bonds representing the unredeemed balance of the

the Registered Owner of any such 2015 Bond of a denomination greater than the principal
amount to be redeemed shall fail to present such 2015 Bond to the Trustee for payment and
exchange as aforesaid, such 2015 Bond shall, nevertheless, become due and payable on the
date fixed for redemption to the extent of the portion of the principal amount called for redemption
(and to that extent only).
If any of the 2015 Bonds are called for redemption, the Trustee shall give notice, in
the name of the Issuer, of the redemption of such 2015 Bonds, by mailing a copy of such notice
by certified mail or registered mail, postage prepaid not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior
to the redemption date which notice shall (i) specify the 2015 Bonds to be redeemed, the
redemption date, the redemption price, and the place or places where amounts due upon such
redemption will be payable (which shall be the Principal Office of the Trustee) and, if less than all
of the 2015 Bonds are to be redeemed, the numbers of the 2015 Bonds, and the portion of the
2015 Bonds, so to be redeemed, (ii) state any condition to such redemption, and (iii) state that on
the redemption date, and upon the satisfaction of any such condition, the 2015 Bonds to be
redeemed shall cease to bear interest, provided that funds are available for such purpose on that
date, and if funds are not available on such date, the redemption shall be deferred until funds are
available. Such notice may set forth any additional information relating to such redemption. Such
notice by mail shall be given at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for
redemption to the holders of 2015 Bonds to be redeemed. No defect in any such notice shall in
any manner defeat the effectiveness of the call for redemption.
Any 2015 Bonds and portions of 2015 Bonds which have been duly selected for
redemption and which are deemed to be paid in accordance with Article VII of the Indenture shall
cease to bear interest on the specified redemption date.
Official notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the 20125 Bonds or
portions of 2015 Bonds so to be redeemed shall, on the redemption date, become due and
payable at the redemption price specified in the notice, and from and after such date (unless there
is a default in the payment of the redemption price) such 2015 Bonds or portions of 2015 Bonds
shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of such 2015 Bonds for redemption in accordance
with said notice, such 2015 Bonds shall be paid by the Trustee at the redemption price. Upon
surrender for any partial redemption of any 2015 Bonds, there shall be issued to the Registered
Owner a new 2015 Bond or 2015 Bonds in the amount of the unredeemed principal in an
Authorized Denomination. All 2015 Bonds which have been redeemed shall be canceled and
destroyed by the Trustee and shall not be reissued.
In addition to the official notice of redemption, if the 2015 Bonds are not then held
under a book-entry only system, further notice shall be given by the Trustee in the name of the
Issuer as set out below; provided, that neither the failure to give any such notice nor any defect in
any notice so given shall affect the sufficiency or validity of any proceedings for the redemption of
the 2015 Bonds. Each further notice of redemption shall contain the information required for an
official notice of redemption plus: (i) the CUSIP numbers of all 2015 Bonds being redeemed; (ii)
the date of issue of the 2015 Bonds as originally issued; (iii) the rate of interest borne by each
2015 Bond being redeemed; (iv) the maturity date of each 2015 Bond being redeemed; and (v)

A-5

 any other descriptive information needed to identify accurately the 2015 Bonds being redeemed.
Each further notice of redemption shall be sent at least 30 days before the redemption date by
certified mail or overnight delivery service to all registered securities depositories then in the
business of holding substantial amounts of obligations of the type comprising the 2015 Bonds and
to one or more national information services, chosen in the discretion of the Trustee, that
disseminate notice of redemption of obligations such as the 2015 Bonds.
The Trustee shall at all reasonable times make available to any interested party
complete information as to 2015 Bonds which have been redeemed or called for redemption.
It is certified, recited and declared that (a) all conditions, acts and things which are
required by the Constitution or by the statutes of the State or by the Resolution or Indenture to
exist, to have happened or to have been performed precedent to or in the issuance of this bond
exist, have happened and have been performed, and (b)the 2015 Bonds, together with all other
indebtedness of the Issuer, are within every debt and other limit prescribed by said Constitution or
statutes.
This bond shall not be entitled to any security or benefit under the terms of the
Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless the certificate of authentication has
been duly executed by the Trustee upon original issuance and thereafter by the Registrar.
