Title:

Letter of support from Local Group 41 of Amnesty
International for reparations to victims and family members
of torture by Chicago Police Department

Committee(s) Assignment:

 I am a member of Local Group 41 of Amnesty International. My concern is for getting
justice for the victims of many decades of abuse and torture by the Chicago Police Department.
I support passage ofthe Ordinance to provide reparations to survivors of torture by the
Chicago's police, specifically:
•

From 1972 to 1991, officers of the Chicago Police Department systematically tortured
over 100 suspects, under the direction of Police Commander Jon Burge at Area 2 and 3
police stations. In addition to beatings. Individuals alleged that they were subjected to
electric shocks; had plastic bags placed over their heads and threatened with mock
executions.

•

Although Burge was convicted in federal court for perjury and obstruction of justice,
neither he nor any ofthe detectives he supervised have been prosecuted for
committing torture.

•

Statutes of limitations not only prevent the ability to obtain justice for these crimes but
also financial reparations for survivors. International law strictly prohibits the use of
torture and other Ill-treatment, and stipulates that governments are responsible for
Investigating torture allegations; bringing criminal proceedings In torture cases and
compensating the victims.

•

It has been more than twenty years since these allegations of torture first came to light.
For all of that time, survivors and their family members have been denied prosecutions
of the crimes alleged and many have been denied reparations to make them whole as
required under international law. Now is the time to take steps to make these survivors
of torture and their families whole again. Please pass the Reparations Ordinance for
Chicago Police Torture Survivors to help take that step.
