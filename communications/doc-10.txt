Letter of support for reparations to victims and family
members of torture by Chicago Police Department

Committee(s) Assignment:

 January, 2015
Chicago City Council
City Hall
121 N. LaSalle Street
Chicago, Illinois 60602
Dear Chicago City Council members.
We, the undersigned, urge you to meet your legal obligafions to ensure that survivors of Chicago police
torture receive compensation by passing the Reparations Ordinance for the Chicago Police Torture
Survivors.
From 1972 to 1991, officers of the Chicago Police Department systematically tortured over 100 AfricanAmerican men, who suffered beafings, electric shocks, suffocations, and mock executions, abuses which
often forced them into falsely confessing to crimes they didn't commit. Many received sentences of
long prison terms or even the death penalty. None of the officers involved have been prosecuted for
torture nor have the vast majority of torture victims received compensation, as the statute of limitations
on the crimes was allowed to expire while the victims waited for justice.
Internafional law, including treafies ratified by the US Congress, strictly prohibits torture and requires
that governments investigate allegations of torture, prosecute torturers, and compensate the victims of
torture. While the city of Chicago has failed the torture vicfims in many ways, you now have the
opportunity to uphold the law and compensate the vicfims for years of suffering.
We urge you to seize this opportunity to help right this terrible injusfice and restore Chicago's tarnished
reputafion by passing the Reparations Ordinance for the Chicago Police Torture Survivors.
Sincerely,

Name
