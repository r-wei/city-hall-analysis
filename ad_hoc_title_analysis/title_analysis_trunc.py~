#This analysis supposes that thematic part of a document is contained in the first few words of its title. We truncate each title to its first n words (for n in trunc_lengths below), and print statistics related to grouping documents according to their truncated titles. We also print a list of common truncated titles for further analysis. As usual, we list the tunable parameters first.
