#We apply ideas from ch 3 of Programming Collective Intelligence to texts from documents in city hall monitor.
#Namely, we construct the correlation matrix of keywords vs documents and see what that can teach us about organizing/grouping the documents.

#print the related words/pairs
#In our example, we didn't do much better than nltk methods 
#or parsing by looking at prepositional phrases.
#Possible benefits of this method: don't have to look for common prepositional structures by hand;
#good for finding related themes, but other methods were better for actually sorting documents
for pair in pairs:
    print(pair)
print(len(pairs))

#FOUR: Analyze the columns of correlation_matrix:

#method 1: find optimal hyperplanes that separate the groups of column vectors
#find the diameter of the column vectors

#method 2: k-means
#1. use k-means to group row vectors into keyword groups
#1b. merge keywords into keyword-groups (maybe by taking the average count of all keywords in a group as features for documents?)
#2. use k-means to group columns

#grouping column vectors (i.e., documents)
k=7 #number of document centroids, can play with this parameter
new_corr_matrix_t = np.transpose(new_corr_matrix) #k-means works on rows


#kmeans seems to give very disparate results
iterations = 10 #number of times to run kmeans; can change
group_counts = [0]*6

for j in range(iterations):
    keyword_centroids = kmeans2(new_corr_matrix_t,k, minit='points')
    #print keyword_centroids #prints [list of centroids, list of centroid assignments]

    assignments = keyword_centroids[1].tolist()
    for i in range(6):
        group_counts[i] = assignments.count(i)
    print(sorted(group_counts), sum(group_counts)) #prints number of documents per group, and the total number of docs grouped




#Other matters:
#Can we use documents with lots of rare words to identify documents with lots of misspellings?
#Problems of scale involving sparse matrices--use scikit (ubuntu/virtual env issues), SVMs?
