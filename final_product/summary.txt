Questions we've had:
- Should we merge the Parking group with the Traffic group?
- Should "amendments to the municipal code" be included in the Parking and Exemptions groups?
- What are tag day permits?
- What is the Other group about?
- The Tax group probably has some newsworthy things.
- Claims group: Are payments to firefighters and policemen realy like refunds and condo claims?
- What is left in the 8% not included in this group? --could continue sorting "amendment of municipal code" docs thematically
